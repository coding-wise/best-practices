# Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

The idea is that if you are doing the same thing in different places you should probably extract to a function that can be called from both places without repeating the function code all over again.

The violation of the principle is refered as WET which stand for either "write everything twice", "we enjoy typing" or "waste everyone's time".
